## Wireless Networks
* Although we will briefly look at other types of wireless networks, in this section of the course we will be focusing on wireless LANs using Wi-Fi.
* The standards we use for wireless LANs are defined in IEEE 802.11.
* The term **Wi-Fi** is a trademark of the **Wi-Fi Alliance**, not directly connected to the IEEE.
* The Wi-Fi Alliance tests and certifies equipment for 802.11 standards compliance interoperability with other devices.
