## What Are ACLs?
* ACLs (Access Control Lists) have multiple uses.
	* We are focusing on ACLs from a security perspective. Control who has access to different parts of the network.
* ACLs function as a packet filter, instructing the router to permit or discard specific traffic.
	* The default behavior is to forward all traffic.
* ACLs can filter traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, source/destination Layer 4 ports, etc.
