## Data Serialization
* Data serialization is the process of converting data into a standardized format/structure that can be stored (in a file) or transmitted (over a network) and reconstructed later (ie. by a different application).
	* This allows the data to be communicated between applications in a way both applications understand.
## JSON
* **JSON** (Javascript Object Notation) is an open standard **file format** and **data interchange format** that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects.
* It is standardized in RFC 8259
* It was derived from JavaScript, but it is language-independent and many modern programming languages are able to generate and read JSON data.
	* REST APIs often use JSON.
* *Whitespace* is insignificant.
* JSON can represent four primitive types:
	* string
		* A text value surrounded by double quotes.
	* number
		* A numeric value. It is not surrounded by quotes.
	* boolean 
		* true/false
	* null
		* Represents the intentional absence of nay object value.
* JSON also has two data structures:
	* object
		* An unordered list of key-value pairs (variables).
	* array
