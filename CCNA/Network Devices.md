## Network
A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

## Client
A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.

## Server
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.

## Switch
The primary functionality of switches is switching, which is the process of sharing resources within networks.
* Have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+).
* Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network).
* Do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the internet.
* Catalyst is a Cisco switch model.

## Router
The primary functionality of routers is routing, which is the process of sharing resources between networks.
* ISR is a Cisco Router model.
* Have fewer network interfaces than switches.
* Are used to provide connectivity between LANs.

## Firewall
Firewalls are specialty network security devices that control network traffic entering and exiting the network.
* Network firewalls are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.
* Can be placed inside or outside the network.
* Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
* Are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.
* ASA and Firepower are some Cisco Firewall models.

There is another type of firewall called 'Host-based firewall. This is a software application that filters traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC. Even in a network with a hardware firewall, each host should include a host-based firewall as an extra line of defence.
