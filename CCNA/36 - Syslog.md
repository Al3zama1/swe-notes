## Syslog Overview
* Syslog is an industry standard protocol for message logging.
* On network devices, Syslog can be used to log events such as changes in interface status (up <--> down), change in OSPF neighbor status (up <--> down), system restarts, etc.
* The messages can be displayed in the CLI, saved in the device's RAM, or sent to an external Syslog server.
* Logs are essential when troubleshooting issues, examining the cause of incidents, etc.
* Syslog and SNMP are both used for monitoring and troubleshooting of devices. They are complementary, but their functionalities are different.
