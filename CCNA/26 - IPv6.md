## Why IPv6?
* The main reason is that there simply aren't enough IPv4 addresses available.
* There are 4,294,967,296 (2^32) addresses available.
* When IPv4 was being designed, the creators had no idea the internet would be as large as it is today.
* VLSM, private IPv4 addresses, and NAT have been used to conserve the use of IPv4 address space.
	* These are short-term solutions.
	* The long-term solution is IPv6.
### IPv4 Address Distribution
* IPv4 address assignments are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
* IANA distributes IPv4 address space to various RIPs (Regional Internet Registries), which then assign them to companies that need them.
## Basics of IPv6
* An IPv6 address is 128 bits.
* Addresses are written in hexadecimal.
* An IPv6 address is written as 32 hexadecimal values, split into 8 groups of 4s using colons.
	* 2001:8DB8:5917:EABD:6562:17EA:C92D:59BD
* IPv6 addresses use the slash ( / ) notation to indicate the prefix length, even when configuring the address in the Cisco IOS CLI.
	* No more dotted decimal subnet masks.
	* For example, a /64 indicates that the first half is the network portion and the second half is the host portion.
* There are methods to shorten IPv6 addresses to make them simpler.
