## Why IPv6?
* The main reason is that there simply aren't enough IPv4 addresses available.
* There are 4,294,967,296 (2^32) addresses available.
* When IPv4 was being designed, the creators had no idea the internet would be as large as it is today.
* VLSM, private IPv4 addresses, and NAT have been used to conserve the use of IPv4 address space.
	* These are short-term solutions.
	* The long-term solution is IPv6.
### IPv4 Address Distribution
* IPv4 address assignments are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
* IANA distributes IPv4 address space to various RIPs (Regional Internet Registries), which then assign them to companies that need them.
## Basics of IPv6
* An IPv6 address is 128 bits.
* Addresses are written in hexadecimal.
* An IPv6 address is written as 32 hexadecimal values, split into 8 groups of 4 values using colons.
	* 2001:8DB8:5917:EABD:6562:17EA:C92D:59BD
* IPv6 addresses use the slash ( / ) notation to indicate the prefix length, even when configuring the address in the Cisco IOS CLI.
	* No more dotted decimal subnet masks.
	* For example, a /64 indicates that the first half is the network portion and the second half is the host portion.
* There are methods to shorten IPv6 addresses to make them simpler.
### Shortening (Abbreviating) IPv6 Addresses
* Leading 0s can be removed
	* 2001:0DB8:000A:001B:20A1:0020:0080:34BD
		* 2001:DB8:A:1B:20A1:20:80:34BD
		* The 0s are still part of the address, but there's no need to write them.
* Consecutive quartets of all 0s can be replaced with a double colon (::).
* Consecutive quartets of 0s can only be abbreviated once in an IPv6 address.
	* 2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0080:34BD
		* 2001:DB8::80:34BD
		* Combined both abbreviation methods.
	* 2001:0000:0000:0000:20A1:0000:0000:34BD
		* 2001::20A1:0:0:34BD

### Expanding Shortened IPv6 Addresses
* Put leading 0s where needed (all quartets should have 4 hexadecimal characters).
	* FE80::2:0:0:FBE8
		* FE80::0002:0000:0000:FBE8
* If double colon used, replace it with all-0 quartets. Make sure there are 8 quartets in total.
	* FE80::0002:0000:0000:FBE8
		* FE80:0000:0000:0000:0002:0000:0000:FBE8

### IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses Breakdown
The global unicast addresses are the regular IPv6 addresses that hosts can use over the internet. They aren't private or multicast addresses.

* Typically, an enterprise requesting IPv6 addresses from their ISP will receive a /48 block.
* The convention is to use a /64 prefix length. That means an enterprise has 16 bits to use to make subnets. However, that doesn't mean you'll ever only see /64 prefix lengths.
* The network portion of the address is made up by the 'global routing prefix' and the 'subnet identifier'.
* The remaining 64 bits can be used for hosts.
