This isn't the name of a specific protocol. It's a type of protocol and there are three FHRPs to be aware of for the CCNA. In depth knowledge is not needed, but should be able to compare them.
## The Purpose of FHRPs
A first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) is a computer networking protocol which is designed to protect the default gateway used on a subnetwork by allowing two or more routers to provide backup for that address; in the event of failure of an active router, the backup router will take over the address, usually within a few seconds.

The name 'first-hop' redundancy protocol is used because the default gateway is the 'first-hop' - the first router in the path to whatever destination the PC is sending traffic to.
