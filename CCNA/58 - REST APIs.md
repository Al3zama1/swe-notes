## APIs
* An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other.
* APIs are essential not just for network automation, but for all kinds of applications.
* In SDN architecture, APIs are used to communicate between apps and the SDN controller (via the NBI), and between the SDN controller and the network device (via the SBI).
* The NBI typically uses REST APIs.
* NETCONF and RESTCONFT are popular southbound APIs.
