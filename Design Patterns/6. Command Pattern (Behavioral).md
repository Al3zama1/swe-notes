* Opens a lot of interesting use cases: such as passing commands as method arguments, storing them inside other objects or even switching commands at runtime.
* commands can be serialized, making it easy to write it to and read it from a file, db, etc. Consequently, this object can be schedules, queued, logged, or even sent over the network.
