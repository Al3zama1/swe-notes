Hashes are collections of field-value pairs that can be used to model domain objects in an application.

Redis Hashes are mutable.
* Add
* Change
* Increment
* Remove

Hashes store field values as strings, which means that they are flat. There are no nested Arrays or Object.

# Commands
* HSET: create set
	* HSET player:42 name Artexius race Elf level 4 hp 20 gold 20
* HGETALL: get all fields and values
	* HGETALL player:42
	* this command is practical for Hashes where the number of fields is relatively small. For big Hashes, it is recommended to only get the fields you need.
* HGET: retrieve specific field value
	* HGET player:42 level
* HSET: add field-value pair to an existing HASH
	* HSET player:42 status dazed
* HDEL:delete field-value pair
	* HDEL player:42 
* HINCRBY: increment the value of particular Hash field
	* HINCRBY player:42 gold 120

# Performance of Hash commands
Most Hash commands are O(1), which means they will always perform a task in a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the Hash.

* O(1)
	* HSET
	* HGET
	* HINCRBY
	* HDEL
* O(N)
	* HGETALL (n being the number of fields within the Hash)
