String is the most basic and common redis data type. They are binary safe sequences of bytes. You can store in them things like integers, binary values, comma-separated values, and serialized JSON. Being binary safe means that you can store larger objects, such as images, videos, documents, and sound. The maximum size that can be stored in a String is 512MB.

Redis strings are also great for implementing counters, as there is built in support for incrementing and decrementing integer and floating point values within a string. For this operations to be possible, the encoding is verified before the command execution(verify there is a number in the string).

## What are some practical uses?
