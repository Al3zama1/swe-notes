String is the most basic and common redis data type. They are binary safe sequences of bytes. You can store in them things like integers, binary values, comma-separated values, and serialized JSON. Being binary safe means that you can store larger objects, such as images, videos, documents, and sound.

## What are some practical uses?
They are commonly used to cache 
* API responses
* Session storage
* HTML pages

Redis strings are also great for implementing counters, as there is built in support for incrementing and decrementing integer and floating point values.
