Redis will keep keys in memory until space is required or is forced out by the eviction policy.  Expiration time can be set in milliseconds, seconds, and a UNIX timestamp.

The TTL can be set when the key is first created or can be set afterwards. It is also possible to remove the expiration time from keys.

# Commands
* Set TTL:
	* EXPIRE key seconds
	* EXPIREAT key timestamp
	* PEXPIRE key milliseconds
	* PEXPIREAT key milliseconds-timestamp
		* Add TTL when creating key value 
			* SET key value PX 5000 (set TTL in milliseconds)
			* SET key value EX 50 (set TTL in seconds)
* Examine key TTL (-1 is returned for persisted keys)
	* TTL key (seconds) 
	* PTTL key (milliseconds)
* Remove TTL
	* PERSIST key
