Redis will keep keys in memory until space is required or is forced out by the eviction policy.  Expiration time can be set in milliseconds, seconds, and a UNIX timestamp.

The TTL can be set when the key is first created or can be set afterwards. It is also possible to remove the expiration time from keys.
