Lists in Redis are implemented using a Linked List. Accessing elements from either side of the list is really performant regardless of the size of the list. Furthermore, adding and removing elements from either side of the list is also really performant.  However, linked lists are not so performant when there is a need to access elements in the middle of the linked list - Sorted sets are good for this use case.

## Common Use Cases
* Remember the lates updates posted by users into a social network. 
* Communication between processes, using a consumer-producer pattern where the producer pushes items into a list, and a consumer (usually aÂ _worker_) consumes those items and executes actions. Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.
