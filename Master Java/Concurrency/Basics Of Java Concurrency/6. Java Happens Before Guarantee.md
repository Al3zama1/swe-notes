The `Java happens before guarantee` is a set of rules that govern how the Java VM and CPU is allowed to reorder instructions for performance gains. It makes it possible for threads to rely on when a variable value is synchronized to or from main memory, and which other variables have been synchronized at the same time. The Java happens before guarantee is centered around access to `volatile` variables and variables accessed from within `synchronized` blocks

# Instruction Reordering
Modern CPUs have the ability to execute instructions in parallel when the instructions do not depend on each other. For example, the following two instructions do not depend on each other, therefore they can be executed in parallel
```
a = b + c

d = e + f
```
However, the following two instructions cannot easily be executed in parallel because the second instruction depends on the result of the first instruction.
```
a = b + c
d = a + e
```

Reordering of instructions can increase parallel execution of instructions in the CPU. Increased parallelization means increased performance. 

Instruction reordering is allowed for the Java VM and the CPU as long as the semantics of the program do not change. The end result has to be the same as if the instructions were executed in the exact order they are listed in the source code.
