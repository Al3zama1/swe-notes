The java memory model specifies how the JVM works with the computer's memory (RAM). The JVM is a model of a whole computer so this naturally includes a memory model (the Java memory model).

Knowledge of the Java memory model is needed to design correctly behaving concurrent programs. The java memory model specifies how and when different threads can see values written to shared variables by other threads and how to synchronize access to shared variables when necessary.

# The Internal Java Memory Model
The java memory model used by the JVM divides memory between thread stacks and the heap.

Each thread running in the JVM has its own thread stack - usually called the "call stack". The stack contains information about the methods the thread has called to reach the current point of execution.

* A local variable may be of a primitive type, in which case it is totally kept on the thread stack.
* A local variable may also be a reference to an object. In that case the reference (the local variable) is stored on the thread stack, but the object itself if stored on the heap.
* An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack, even if the object the method belongs to is stored on the heap.
* The Heap contains all objects created in your application, regardless of what thread created the object.
* An object's member variables are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object.
* Static class variables are also stored on the heap along with the class definition.

Objects on the heap can be accessed by all threads that have a reference to the object. When a thread has access to an object, it can also get access to that object's member variables. If two threads call a method on the same object at the same time, they will both have access to the object's member variables, but each thread will have its own copy of the local variables.
