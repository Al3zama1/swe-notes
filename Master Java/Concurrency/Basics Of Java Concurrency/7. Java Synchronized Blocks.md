A Java synchronized block marks a method or block of code as synchronized. A synchronized block in Java can only be executed by a single thread at a time (depending on how you use it). Java synchronized blocks can be used to avoid race conditions.

# Java Concurrency Utilities
The `synchronized` mechanism was Java's first mechanism for synchronizing access to objects shared by multiple threads. The `synchronized` mechanism isn't very advanced though. That is why Java 5 got a whole set of concurrency utilities classes to help developers implement more fine grained concurrency control than what you get with `synchronized`.

# The Java Synchronized Keyword
A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object. All synchronized blocks synchronized on the same object can only have one thread executing inside them at the same time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.

The `synchronized` keyword can be used to mark four different types of blocks:
* Instance methods
* Static methods
* Code blocks inside instance methods
* Code blocks inside static methods

## Synchronized Instance Methods
A synchronized instance method in Java is synchronized on the instance (object) owning the method. Thus, each instance has its synchronized methods synchronized on a different object: the owning instance.

Only one thread per instance can execute inside a synchronized instance method. If more than one instance exist, then one thread at a time can execute inside a synchronized instance method per instance. One thread per instance.

This is true across all synchronized instance methods for the same object (instance). Thus, in the following example, only one thread can execute inside either of of the two synchronized methods. One thread in total per instance:
```
public class MyCounter {

  private int count = 0;

  public **synchronized** void add(int value){
      this.count += value;
  }
  public **synchronized** void subtract(int value){
      this.count -= value;
  }

}
```
## Synchronized Static Methods
Synchronized static methods are synchronized on the class object of the class the synchronized static method belongs to. Since only one class object exists in the Java VM per class, only one thread can execute inside a static synchronized method in the same class.

In case a class contains more than one static synchronized method, only one thread can execute inside any of these methods at the same time.
```
public static MyStaticCounter{

  private static int count = 0;

  public **static synchronized** void add(int value){
    count += value;
  }

  public **static synchronized** void subtract(int value){
    count -= value;
  }
}
```
