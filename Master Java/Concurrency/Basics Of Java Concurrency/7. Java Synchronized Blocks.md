A Java synchronized block marks a method or block of code as synchronized. A synchronized block in Java can only be executed by a single thread at a time (depending on how you use it). Java synchronized blocks can be used to avoid race conditions.

# Java Concurrency Utilities
The `synchronized` mechanism was Java's first mechanism for synchronizing access to objects shared by multiple threads. The `synchronized` mechanism isn't very advanced though. That is why Java 5 got a whole set of concurrency utilities classes to help developers implement more fine grained concurrency control than what you get with `synchronized`.

# The Java Synchronized Keyword
A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object. All synchronized blocks synchronized on the same object can only have one thread executing inside them at the same time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.

The `synchronized` keyword can be used to mark four different types of blocks:
* Instance methods
* Static methods
* Code blocks inside instance methods
* Code blocks inside static methods
